# Processing/Java Projects
All projects and repositories from AP CSA combined into one repo and site!  
Everything is written in Java, specifically through Processing, so that it can be deployed as an easily accessible website.

# Branches
All branches are kept to show the individual commit histories of each project.  
Consider the branches archives as they will no longer be updated.  
All future changes will be applied on separate branches before being merged onto master. Those branches will not be kept and will be deleted once merging is completed.  
Merging casualty: Sierpinski Triangle - Accidentally replaced and overwritten by Starfield and unable to be recovered. Unfortunate.
